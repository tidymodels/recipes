## Introduction

The `recipes` package is an alternative method for creating and preprocessing design matrices that can be used for modeling or visualization. From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_matrix):

 > In statistics, a **design matrix** (also known as regressor matrix or model matrix) is a matrix of values of explanatory variables of a set of objects, often denoted by X. Each row represents an individual object, with the successive columns corresponding to the variables and their specific values for that object.

While R already has long-standing methods for creating these matrices (e.g. [formulas](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/02/01/the-r-formula-method-the-good-parts/) and `model.matrix`), there are some [limitations to what the existing infrastructure can do](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/03/01/the-r-formula-method-the-bad-parts/). 

The idea of the `recipes` package is to define a recipe or blueprint that can be used to sequentially define the encodings and preprocessing of the data (i.e. "feature engineering"). For example, to create a simple recipe containing only an outcome and predictors and have the predictors centered and scaled:

```{r simple, eval = FALSE}
library(recipes)
library(mlbench)
data(Sonar)

sonar_rec <- recipe(Class ~ ., data = Sonar) %>%
  step_center(all_predictors()) %>%
  step_scale(all_predictors())
```

More information on `recipes` can be found at the [_Get Started_](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/recipes/) page of [`tidymodels.org`](https://www.tidymodels.org).
