# Inverse logit transformation

`step_invlogit()` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that will
transform the data from real values to be between zero and one.

## Usage

``` r
step_invlogit(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  columns = NULL,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = rand_id("invlogit")
)
```

## Arguments

- recipe:

  A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of operations
  for this recipe.

- ...:

  One or more selector functions to choose variables for this step. See
  [`selections()`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/reference/selections.md)
  for more details.

- role:

  Not used by this step since no new variables are created.

- trained:

  A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have been
  estimated.

- columns:

  A character string of the selected variable names. This field is a
  placeholder and will be populated once
  [`prep()`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/reference/prep.md) is
  used.

- skip:

  A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by
  [`bake()`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/reference/bake.md)?
  While all operations are baked when
  [`prep()`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/reference/prep.md) is
  run, some operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g.
  processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using
  `skip = TRUE` as it may affect the computations for subsequent
  operations.

- id:

  A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.

## Value

An updated version of `recipe` with the new step added to the sequence
of any existing operations.

## Details

The inverse logit transformation takes values on the real line and
translates them to be between zero and one using the function
`f(x) = 1/(1+exp(-x))`.

## Tidying

When you
[`tidy()`](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/reference/tidy.recipe.md)
this step, a tibble is returned with columns `terms` and `id`:

- terms:

  character, the selectors or variables selected

- id:

  character, id of this step

## Case weights

The underlying operation does not allow for case weights.

## Examples

``` r
data(biomass, package = "modeldata")

biomass_tr <- biomass[biomass$dataset == "Training", ]
biomass_te <- biomass[biomass$dataset == "Testing", ]

rec <- recipe(
  HHV ~ carbon + hydrogen + oxygen + nitrogen + sulfur,
  data = biomass_tr
)

ilogit_trans <- rec |>
  step_center(carbon, hydrogen) |>
  step_scale(carbon, hydrogen) |>
  step_invlogit(carbon, hydrogen)

ilogit_obj <- prep(ilogit_trans, training = biomass_tr)

transformed_te <- bake(ilogit_obj, biomass_te)
plot(biomass_te$carbon, transformed_te$carbon)
```
