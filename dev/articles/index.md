# Articles

### Get started

- [Introduction to
  recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/recipes.md):

  Start here if this is your first time using recipes! You will learn
  about basic usage, steps, selectors, and checks.

### Learn more

- [Handling categorical
  predictors](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/Dummies.md):

  This vignette describes different methods for encoding categorical
  predictors, with special attention to interaction terms and contrasts.

- [Selecting
  variables](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/Selecting_Variables.md):

  You can select which variables or features should be used in recipes.
  This vignette goes over the basics of using selection functions.

- [Roles in
  recipes](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/Roles.md):

  In recipes, roles provide a way to select variables for different
  steps.

- [On skipping
  steps](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/Skipping.md):

  In recipes, steps are usually applied to both the training and testing
  sets. However, in some situations we only want to only apply a step to
  the training data and we want to skip that step on testing data.

### Practical advice

- [Ordering of
  steps](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/Ordering.md):

  The order in which recipe steps are specified matters, and this
  vignette gives some general suggestions that you should consider.

### Developer

- [Custom Steps](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/develop/recipes/):

  Write a new recipe step for data preprocessing.

- [Recipes
  Internals](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/internals.md):

  Overview and explanation of recipe object internals.

- [Dev
  checklists](https://recipes.tidymodels.org/dev/articles/checklists.md):

  These are checklists used by the tidymodels team, extension package
  authors and contributors.

### Examples

- [Subsampling for Class
  Imbalances](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/models/sub-sampling/):

  Improve model performance in imbalanced data sets through
  undersampling or oversampling.

- [Multivariate Analysis using Partial Least
  Squares](https://www.tidymodels.org/learn/models/pls/):

  Build and fit a predictive model with more than one outcome.
