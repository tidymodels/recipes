\usage{
step_rm(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  removals = NULL,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = rand_id("rm")
)

\method{tidy}{step_rm}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which
variables that will evaluated by the filtering bake. See
\code{\link[=selections]{selections()}} for more details. For the \code{tidy}
method, these are not currently used.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are
created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{removals}{A character string that contains the names of
columns that should be removed. These values are not determined
until \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}} is called.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[=bake.recipe]{bake.recipe()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}

\item{x}{A \code{step_rm} object.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step
added to the sequence of existing steps (if any). For the
\code{tidy} method, a tibble with columns \code{terms} which
is the columns that will be removed.
}
\description{
\code{step_rm} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step
that will remove variables based on their name, type, or role.
