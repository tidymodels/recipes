\usage{
step_classdist(
  recipe,
  ...,
  class,
  role = "predictor",
  trained = FALSE,
  mean_func = mean,
  cov_func = cov,
  pool = FALSE,

\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose variables
for this step. See \code{\link[=selections]{selections()}} for more details.}

\item{class}{A single character string that specifies a single
categorical variable to be used as the class.}

\item{role}{For model terms created by this step, what analysis role should
they be assigned? By default, the new columns created by this step from
the original variables will be used as \emph{predictors} in a model.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{mean_func}{A function to compute the center of the
distribution.}

\item{cov_func}{A function that computes the covariance matrix}

\item{pool}{A logical: should the covariance matrix be computed
by pooling the data for all of the classes?}

\item{log}{A logical: should the distances be transformed by
the natural log function?}

\item{objects}{Statistics are stored here once this step has
been trained by \code{\link[=prep]{prep()}}.}

\item{prefix}{A character string for the prefix of the resulting new
variables. See notes below.}

\item{keep_original_cols}{A logical to keep the original variables in the
output. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[=bake]{bake()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[=prep]{prep()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step added to the
sequence of any existing operations.
}
\description{
\code{step_classdist()} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe step that will
convert numeric data into Mahalanobis distance measurements to the data
centroid. This is done for each value of a categorical class variable.
}
\details{
\code{step_classdist} will create a new column for every unique value of
the \code{class} variable. The resulting variables will not replace the original
values and, by default, have the prefix \code{classdist_}. The naming format can
be changed using the \code{prefix} argument.

Class-specific centroids are the multivariate averages of each predictor
using the data from each class in the training set. When pre-processing a
new data point, this step computes the distance from the new point to each
of the class centroids. These distance features can be very effective at
capturing linear class boundaries. For this reason, they can be useful to
add to an existing predictor set used within a nonlinear model. If the true
boundary is actually linear, the model will have an easier time learning the
training data patterns.

Note that, by default, the default covariance function requires
that each class should have at least as many rows as variables
listed in the \code{terms} argument. If \code{pool = TRUE},
there must be at least as many data points are variables
overall.

\section{Tidying}{
When you \code{\link[=tidy.recipe]{tidy()}} this step, a tibble is returned with
columns \code{terms}, \code{value}, \code{class} , and \code{id}:

\describe{
\item{terms}{character, the selectors or variables selected}
\item{value}{numeric, location of centroid}
\item{class}{character, name of the class}
\item{id}{character, id of this step}
}
}

\section{Case weights}{


This step performs an supervised operation that can utilize case weights.
As a result, case weights are used with frequency weights as well as
importance weights. For more information,, see the documentation in
\link{case_weights} and the examples on \code{tidymodels.org}.
