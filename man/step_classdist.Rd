step_classdist(
  recipe,
  ...,
  class,
  role = "predictor",
  trained = FALSE,

\method{tidy}{step_classdist}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which
variables are affected by the step. See \code{\link[=selections]{selections()}}
for more details. For the \code{tidy} method, these are not
currently used.}

\item{class}{A single character string that specifies a single
categorical variable to be used as the class.}

\item{role}{For model terms created by this step, what analysis
role should they be assigned?. By default, the function assumes
that resulting distances will be used as predictors in a model.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{mean_func}{A function to compute the center of the
distribution.}

\item{cov_func}{A function that computes the covariance matrix}

\item{pool}{A logical: should the covariance matrix be computed
by pooling the data for all of the classes?}

\item{log}{A logical: should the distances be transformed by
the natural log function?}

\item{objects}{Statistics are stored here once this step has
been trained by \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}}.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[=bake.recipe]{bake.recipe()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}

\item{x}{A \code{step_classdist} object.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step
added to the sequence of existing steps (if any). For the
\code{tidy} method, a tibble with columns \code{terms} (the
selectors or variables selected), \code{value} (the centroid of
the class), and \code{class}.
}
\description{
\code{step_classdist} creates a \emph{specification} of a
recipe step that will convert numeric data into Mahalanobis
distance measurements to the data centroid. This is done for
each value of a categorical class variable.
}
\details{
\code{step_classdist} will create a new column for every
unique value of the \code{class} variable.
The resulting variables will not replace the original values
and have the prefix \code{classdist_}.

Note that, by default, the default covariance function requires
that each class should have at least as many rows as variables
listed in the \code{terms} argument. If \code{pool = TRUE},
there must be at least as many data points are variables
overall.
