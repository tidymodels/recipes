## Effects of non-standard roles


Recipes can label and retain column(s) of your data set that should not be treated as outcomes or predictors. A unique identifier column or some other ancillary data could be used to troubleshoot issues during model development but may not be either an outcome or predictor.

For example, the [modeldata::biomass] data have a column called `sample` with information about the specific sample type. We can change that role: 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
  data(biomass, package = "modeldata")

  recipe(HHV ~ ., data = biomass) %>%
    update_role(sample, new_role = "id variable")
```

This means that the `sample` column will not be used in the analysis but will be retained in the data set (see more in the Examples section below). 

As another example, you might have a date column that is transformed into features using [step_date()] or [step_holiday()]. 

```{r, results = "hide", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
  library(tidymodels)
  tidymodels_prefer()

  data(Chicago, package = "modeldata")
  chi_rec <- recipe(ridership ~ ., data = Chicago) %>% 
    # Since `date` is symbolically on the right-hand side of the formula, it
    # is treated as a predictor (i.e., has a role of "predictor")
    step_holiday(date) %>% 
    step_date(date)
```

At this point, `date` is kept in the dataset as-is, and will be treated as a predictor (and will probably be converted to an integer column by the modeling function). 

One option is to remove `date` since it is not directly used as a model term. [step_rm()] is a good way to accomplish this. 

```{r}
  chi_rec_rm <- chi_rec %>% step_rm(date)
```

Another approach, especially helpful during model development, is to change the role of the column to some other value via [update_role()]. 

```{r}
  chi_rec_role <- chi_rec %>% update_role(date, new_role = "date")
```

In this case, the column is still available in the data and will be carried through the analysis (e.g. during resampling). This can be helpful since, if there is a poor prediction, this column may be helpful in diagnosing the problem. 

The downside to chaining the role of the column is that it is needed at prediction-time. This can impact development tools (such as tuning functions) and would also be required to be in the data being predicted once the model is deployed. 

If using a non-standard role for a column, it is highly recommended that you use the recipe within a workflow and specify `bake_dependent_roles` as described in [hardhat::default_recipe_blueprint()]. This will allow tuning and prediction functions to run without error. 

With the example above:

```{r, warning = FALSE}
  library(hardhat) # require hardhat version >= 1.0.0
  # Make a new blueprint:
  date_bp <- default_recipe_blueprint(bake_dependent_roles = "date")

  chi_wflow <- 
    workflow() %>% 
    add_model(linear_reg()) %>% 
    add_recipe(chi_rec_role, blueprint = date_bp) 

  chi_fit <- fit(chi_wflow, Chicago)
  # This line will fail without the added blueprint:
  predict(chi_fit, head(Chicago))
```

It is also worth noting that [workflows::augment.workflow()] can be used to attach predictions to the data (including columns with non-standard roles):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
  augment(chi_fit, head(Chicago))
```
