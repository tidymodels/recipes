```{r}
#| include: false
low_range <- paste0("\`", prefix, 1, "\` - \`", prefix, 9, "\`")
high_range <- paste0("\`", prefix, 001, "\` - \`", prefix, 101, "\`")
```

The argument `num_comp` controls the number of components that will be retained
(the original variables that are used to derive the components are removed from
the data). The new components will have names that begin with `prefix` and a 
sequence of numbers. The variable names are padded with zeros. For example, if 
`num_comp < 10`, their names will be `r low_range`. If `num_comp = 101`, 
the names would be `r high_range`.
