\usage{
check_missing(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  columns = NULL,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = rand_id("missing")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The check will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which
variables are checked in the check See \code{\link[=selections]{selections()}}
for more details.}

\item{role}{Not used by this check since no new variables are
created.}

\item{trained}{A logical for whether the selectors in \code{...}
have been resolved by \code{\link[=prep]{prep()}}.}

\item{columns}{A character string of variable names that will
be populated (eventually) by the terms argument.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the check be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[=bake.recipe]{bake.recipe()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new check
added to the sequence of existing operations (if any).
}
\description{
\code{check_missing} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe
operation that will check if variables contain missing values.
}
\details{
This check will break the \code{bake} function if any of the checked
columns does contain \code{NA} values. If the check passes, nothing is changed
to the data.

When you \code{\link[=tidy]{tidy()}} this check, a tibble with column \code{terms} (the
selectors or variables selected) is returned.
