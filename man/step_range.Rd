\title{Scaling Numeric Data to a Specific Range}
\usage{
step_range(
  recipe,
  ...,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  min = 0,
  max = 1,
  ranges = NULL,
  skip = FALSE,
  id = rand_id("range")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the
sequence of operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which
variables will be scaled. See \code{\link[=selections]{selections()}} for more
details.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are
created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for
preprocessing have been estimated.}

\item{min}{A single numeric value for the smallest value in the
range.}

\item{max}{A single numeric value for the largest value in the
range.}

\item{ranges}{A character vector of variables that will be
normalized. Note that this is ignored until the values are
determined by \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}}. Setting this value will
be ineffective.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the
recipe is baked by \code{\link[=bake.recipe]{bake.recipe()}}? While all operations are baked
when \code{\link[=prep.recipe]{prep.recipe()}} is run, some operations may not be able to be
conducted on new data (e.g. processing the outcome variable(s)).
Care should be taken when using \code{skip = TRUE} as it may affect
the computations for subsequent operations}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of \code{recipe} with the new step
added to the sequence of existing steps (if any).
}
\description{
\code{step_range} creates a \emph{specification} of a recipe
step that will normalize numeric data to be within a pre-defined
range of values.
}
\details{
When a new data point is outside of the ranges seen in
the training set, the new values are truncated at \code{min} or
\code{max}.

When you \code{\link[=tidy]{tidy()}} this step, a tibble with columns \code{terms} (the
selectors or variables selected), \code{min}, and \code{max} is returned.
