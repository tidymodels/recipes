## Introduction

With recipes, you can use [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)-like
pipeable sequences of feature engineering steps to get your data ready
for modeling. For example, to create a recipe containing an outcome plus
two numeric predictors and then center and scale (“normalize”) the
predictors:

``` r
library(recipes)
data(ad_data, package = "modeldata")

ad_rec <- recipe(Class ~ tau + VEGF, data = ad_data) %>%
  step_normalize(all_numeric_predictors())

ad_rec
#> Data Recipe
#> 
#> Inputs:
#> 
#>       role #variables
#>    outcome          1
#>  predictor          2
#> 
#> Operations:
#> 
#> Centering and scaling for all_numeric_predictors()
```

More information on recipes can be found at the [*Get
Started*](https://www.tidymodels.org/start/recipes/) page of
[tidymodels.org](https://www.tidymodels.org).

You may consider recipes as an alternative method for creating and
preprocessing design matrices (also known as model matrices) that can be
used for modeling or visualization. While R already has long-standing
methods for creating such matrices
(e.g. [formulas](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/02/01/the-r-formula-method-the-good-parts/)
and `model.matrix`), there are some [limitations to what the existing
infrastructure can
do](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/03/01/the-r-formula-method-the-bad-parts/).

## Installation

There are several ways to install recipes:

``` r
# The easiest way to get recipes is to install all of tidymodels:
install.packages("tidymodels")

# Alternatively, install just recipes:
install.packages("recipes")

# Or the development version from GitHub:
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("tidymodels/recipes")
```
