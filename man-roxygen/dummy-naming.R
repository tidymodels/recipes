#' @details
#' This recipe step allows for flexible naming of the resulting
#' variables. For an unordered factor named `x`, with levels `"a"`
#' and `"b"`, the default naming convention would be to create a
#' new variable called `x_b`. The naming format can be changed using
#' the `naming` argument; the function [dummy_names()] is the
#' default.
