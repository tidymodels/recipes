These are checklists used by the tidymodels team. If you want to use them to add models and/or engines in your own package, you will have to adapt them somewhat.

Copy these checklists into the corresponding GitHub issue.

## Adding an argument to an existing step

```
* [ ] Document argument for the given step, `step_name()` will be used as example.

* [ ] Add argument to `step_name()`, making sure that it is passed to `step_name_new()` in `add_step()`.

* [ ] Add argument to `step_name_new()` and make sure it is passed to `step()`.

* [ ] Make sure argument is passed to `step_umap_new()` in `prep.step_name()`.

* [ ] Add the following code to `prep.step_name()`. This will prevent older recipes from breaking.
    ```
    if (is.null(x$new_arg)) {
      x$new_arg <- default-value-for-new_arg
    }
    ```

* [ ] Add test to make sure you didn't mess up the above tasks.
    ```
    test_that("backwards compatible for new_arg", {
      rec <- recipe(~ ., data = data_set_of_your_choice) |>
        step_name(all_predictors()) |>
        prep()
  
      exp <- bake(rec, data_set_of_your_choice)
  
      rec$steps[[1]]$new_arg <- NULL
  
      expect_identical(
        bake(rec, data_set_of_your_choice),
        exp
      )
    })
    ```

* [ ] Test that new argument works.
```
