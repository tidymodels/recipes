#' Down-Sample a Data Set Based on a Factor Variable
#'
#' `step_downsample` creates a *specification* of a recipe
#'  step that will remove rows of a data set to make the occurrence
#'  of levels in a specific factor level equal.
#'
#' @inheritParams step_center
#' @param ... One or more selector functions to choose which
#'  variable is used to sample the data. See [selections()]
#'  for more details. The selection should result in _single
#'  factor variable_. For the `tidy` method, these are not
#'  currently used.
#' @param role Not used by this step since no new variables are
#'  created.
#' @param column A character string of the variable name that will
#'  be populated (eventually) by the `...` selectors.
#' @param under_ratio A numeric value for the ratio of the
#'  minority-to-majority frequencies. The default value (1) means
#'  that all other levels are sampled down to have the same
#'  frequency as the least occurring level. A value of 2 would mean
#'  that the majority levels will have (at most) (approximately)
#'  twice as many rows than the minority level.
#' @param ratio Depracated argument; same as `under_ratio`
#' @param target An integer that will be used to subsample. This
#'  should not be set by the user and will be populated by `prep`.
#' @param seed An integer that will be used as the seed when downsampling.
#' @return An updated version of `recipe` with the new step
#'  added to the sequence of existing steps (if any). For the
#'  `tidy` method, a tibble with columns `terms` which is
#'  the variable used to sample.
#' @details
#' Down-sampling is intended to be performed on the _training_ set
#'  alone. For this reason, the default is `skip = TRUE`. It is
#'  advisable to use `prep(recipe, retain = TRUE)` when preparing
#'  the recipe; in this way [juice()] can be used to obtain the
#'  down-sampled version of the data.
#'
#' If there are missing values in the factor variable that is used
#'  to define the sampling, missing data are selected at random in
#'  the same way that the other factor levels are sampled. Missing
#'  values are not used to determine the amount of data in the
#'  minority level
#'
#' For any data with factor levels occurring with the same
#'  frequency as the minority level, all data will be retained.
#'
#' All columns in the data are sampled and returned by [juice()]
#'  and [bake()].
#'
#' Keep in mind that the location of down-sampling in the step
#'  may have effects. For example, if centering and scaling,
#'  it is not clear whether those operations should be conducted
#'  _before_ or _after_ rows are removed.
#'
#' When used in modeling, users should strongly consider using the
#'  option `skip = TRUE` so that the extra sampling is _not_
#'  conducted outside of the training set.
